    /**
    * This flag controls how errors are processed as payloads arrive via Kafka into the application
    * and are decrypted. Actual encryption / decryption of data wonâ€™t be handled by this application
    * but is instead handled by a downstream encryption / decryption remote service. Failures may
    * arise from the remote service not being online or the encrypted data may not be in the right
    * format or the application's authentication with the remote decryption service not being
    * authorized to decrypt the data.
    *
    * <p>In the case that the flag is <code>true</code> then any failure that arises during
    * decryption will be raised in the Spring MVC system.
    *
    * <p>In the case that the flag is <code>false</code> then any failure that arises during
    * decryption will be deferred to the point where the software actually attempts to access the
    * clear-field. The clear field will be provided in a {@link DecryptedClearValue} wrapper and in
    * the case that the field experienced an error during decryption, it will be in state {@link
    * DecryptedClearValue.State#ERROR} and attempting to use the {@link DecryptedClearValue#get()}
    * method will yield a runtime exception. This mechanism is intended for situations where
    * engineers of an application proactively want to handle failure in some specific way at the
    * field level.
    *
    * <p>An example of where field-level error handling would make sense is with a fictitious payload
    * such as;
    *
    * <pre>{
    *     "orderId": "ABC-DEF-HIJ",
    *     "status": "DELIVERED",
    *     "recipientEmailEncrypted": "vault:v1:hi238r723rhad03u03="
    * }
    * </pre>
    *
    * <p>In this example, the processing of the message MUST persist that the order was delivered. A
    * secondary function is to email the user to let them know, but if the user can't be emailed then
    * that is acceptable. In this case, not being able to decrypt the recipient's email could fail
    * and the overall processing of the message would be OK.
    *
    * <pre>try {
    *     mailService.send(...., payload.getRecipientEmail().get());
    * } catch (Throwable th) {
    *     ...log and continue...
    * }
    * </pre>
    *
    * <p>If the <code>errorOnDecryptionFailure</code> had been set to <code>true</code> and the field
    * <code>recipientEmailEncrypted</code> were unable to be decrypted then the business logic would
    * never have been able to be reached.
    *
    * <p>For most applications, this flag would be expected to be set to <code>true</code> as it
    * provides the simplest error handling path. The setting for this field would usually be set in
    * the application's <code>application.yml</code> file.

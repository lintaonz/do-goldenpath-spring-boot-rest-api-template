# Welcome
You have just created a Backstage managed dev environment.
We use backstage to manage the Service Creation, cataloging, life cycle management and documentation for services based on golden path standards.

You now have a basic environment that you can build upon.

**TODO**: Please update **this** page with details about **your** project.

## Things to note:
1. The backstage portal is your home for all things related to your service. Its a great place to live
2. Docs travel with your service. Docs relating to your service should be annotated in the `/docs` directory, and added
to the `/mkdocs.yaml` to ensure the docs are published on backstage for everyone to consume.
3. CI/CD has been set up, you can connect to these services directly form the backstage portal

## Let's Start
Now all the hard work is out of the way, you're free to do your thing. Code away!
